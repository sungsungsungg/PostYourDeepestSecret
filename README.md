# Post Your Deepest Secret

> Built with JS, Node.js, Express.js, EJS, and CSS.

Share your deepest secrets with a passcode so only you can access themâ€”unless you choose to share the password with someone else.

Feel free to give it a try!

There hasn't been much effort put on front-end (it's mainly for my practice with Node.js), but I'm happy to bring this AWESOME site to life upon any request :)


## Instructions

1. Ensure you're in the correct directory.
2. Install the required modules using npm:
```
npm install
```
3. Run the application using Node.js (make sure you have Node.js installed):
```
node index.js
```
Visit the blog site at http://localhost:3000/

Enjoy!
